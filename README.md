## Description

 PhillyGrove is an application that serves as a community bulletin board for the inhabitants of Philadelphia! On PhillyGrove, one can view a list of upcoming events in their area, a brief description of what can be expected, the date of the event, as well as user comments. If someone in the Philadelphia area is interested in posting a community event, be it a garage sale or charity event, all one needs to do is create a free account with the sign up button. Once an account is created, a user can create as many events as they so please, and will have access to a userdashboard that contains a history of all of their past events.  
 
Whereas the currently fashionable social media platforms provide an online community, they often become over-saturated and politicized, which distracts its users as opposed to aiding them in their endeavors.  PhillyGrove is a potential re-centering of what social media can do, which is provide a space for communities to advertise online and come to fruition in the real world-a bulletin board for your city that gets down to business.
